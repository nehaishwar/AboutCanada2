This application is involves building a “proof of concept” app which consumes a REST service and displays photos with
headings and descriptions.

An Android app which:
1. Ingests a json feed from
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2iodh4vg0eortkl/facts.json
2. The feed contains a title and a list of rows
3. The title in the toolbar updated from the json
4. Displays the content (including image, title and description) as a
   list of rows
5. Each row should be the right height to display its own content
   and no taller.
6. Loads the images lazily
7. Don’t download them all at once, but only as needed
8. Refresh function swipe-to-refresh
9. Should not block UI when loading the data from the json feed.


This app is using Recycler view to display Table contents and Images are uploaded using Picasso.
